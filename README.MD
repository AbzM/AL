Welcome to the code sample repo for developing extensions to Dynamics NAV.

This repo contains AL language code samples for developing extensions on the Dynamics NAV platform. We're not yet in preview, so this repo is meant as a way for you to get familiar with the new syntax and provide feedback.

<!-- Get started by cloning one of the sample projects from this repo, open the folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and you’re ready to compile, publish, and run.-->

We're still in preview, so you might bump into bugs. We're sorry about that, but we're working as fast as we can to fix them.
